# KaryotypeSVG - SVG based ideograms of chromosomes showing cytogenetic bands

This project allows to draw SVG graphics showing one (or multiple) ideograms of chromosomes showing cytogenetic bands.

## Acknowledgments

The code is derived from Thomas Down's original [karyoscape code](https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance/blob/0.7.x/js/karyoscape.js) and interacts well with [Biodalliance](https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance) using an event model.
