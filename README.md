# KaryotypeSVG - SVG based ideograms of chromosomes showing cytogenetic bands

This project allows to draw SVG graphics showing one (or multiple) ideograms of chromosomes showing cytogenetic bands.

The code is derived from Thomas Down's original [karyoscape code](https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance/blob/0.7.x/js/karyoscape.js) and interacts well with [Biodalliance](https://github.com/dasmoth/dalliance) using an event model.
